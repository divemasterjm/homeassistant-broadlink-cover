# homeassistant-broadlink-cover
Home Assistant cover component for Broadlink RM devices. Modified from the official Broadlink switch component.

## Future

When I put this on the GitHub, it was mostly for backup purpose. Now I realized that some other people may also need this little component. I am considering improve the component and try to create a pull request and merge it into the Home Assistant. I will do the documentation and write some tests. Any issues and pull requests are welcome.
